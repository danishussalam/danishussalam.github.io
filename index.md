      I work as an Economist in the Climate Change Unit (CCU) at the Central Bank of Ireland. I received my PhD in Economics from Trinity College Dublin (2023). I began my career working on anti-poverty and education programs across East and West Africa, including asset transfer initiatives in post-conflict regions, school monitoring schemes to boost educational outcomes, and high-school entrepreneurship programs to foster entrepreneurial skills among youth. More recently, at the Central Bank of Ireland, I designed experimental interventions to enhance consumer protection, including tests to improve risk comprehension around crypto assets and strategies to mitigate online financial fraud. I am currently interested in testing behavioural nudges to enhance financial decision-making, particularly in contexts involving high uncertainty and digital financial products.

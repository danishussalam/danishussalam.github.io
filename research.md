      The growing popularity of crypto assets has driven increased engagement, often
fuelled by promotional content that highlights past returns while downplaying risks.
This paper evaluates the effectiveness of behaviourally informed risk warnings in
such a setting. Using an online randomized controlled trial, participants viewed simulated investment promotions for two financial products: stocks and crypto assets.
Treatments combined behaviorally informed risk warnings with past return information, the same information but with returns shown before warnings, or risk warnings
paired with price volatility cues. The first treatment significantly improved risk comprehension and perception by 5% and 4%. These effects are further magnified by
the order in which information is presented and by increasing the salience of risk
information. Showing risk warnings after potential returns increases risk comprehension by 12% and risk perception by 6%, suggesting evidence in favor of recency
bias. Similarly, showing risk warnings and price volatility cues improves risk comprehension by 10% and risk perception by 7%, reflecting the effect of heightened risk
salience. These effects are driven by at-risk investors, defined as individuals who
follow crypto market updates on social media but have not yet invested in crypto
assets. In line with prior evidence, we find no effect among those who have previously invested in crypto assets, likely because their decisions are shaped more by
past investment outcomes than by ex-ante warnings.

      Using a cluster-randomized controlled trial, this study evaluates the impact of group-based interpersonal therapy (IPT-G) on mental health and human capital accumulation among adolescent girls in Uganda who were at risk of moderate to severe depression at baseline. The study was designed to test whether lay provider-led IPT-G for adolescents could be effectively implemented using modest resources in a low-income country. It also tested whether a lump-sum cash transfer offered at the end of therapy provided any additional benefit. The therapy intervention alone increased the share of individuals with no depression by 5.4 percentage points (from 18.4% in the control group) 12 months after therapy, but these effects dissipated by the 30-month follow-up. Similarly, small positive effects on human capital accumulation at 12 months were not sustained at 30 months. Surprisingly, the marginal effect of offering cash transfers to IPT-G beneficiaries was large and negative on their mental health, persisting two years after baseline. The paper provides suggestive evidence that the adolescents were frustrated by their inability to use the cash towards their own goals because of the need to divert funds towards the essential needs of their families during the COVID-19 pandemic.
